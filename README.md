## Objective
The objective of this work is to implement communication between agents, and for this communication to affect the decisions these agents take.

## Description
The agents in this project play a version of *The Price Is Right* where there are two types of agents: audience and competitors.

In the beginning, each element of the audience is told the price of a few items. At the start of a round, an item is chosen and the audience guesses a first time.
Then, the audience shares their guess with each other and each agent may change their initial guess. After everyone in the audience has a guess, 
the competitors ask the audience their guess. If an elemnt of the audience likes a competitor, they will send their guess, if they do not like him, they ignore the request.
The competitors then have their chance to take a guess. The competitor with the closest guess wins.

After each round, each agent (audience and competitors) will change their confidence on other agents based on their accuracy on the previous round.
The can play with any number of rounds, audience members, competitors and items.

## First Delivery
For the first delivery, made on 15/11/2020, the contents of the project were like on commit [3118ff6](https://github.com/Pastilhas/AIAD-FEUP/commit/3118ff611fef95e0babf14fea256b1fc7a4ceeb4). The code and report may contain errors and should not be used without previous inspection. 
After this point starts the second delivery which consists of adapting the project using Simple API for JADE-based Simulations ([SAJaS](https://web.fe.up.pt/~hlc/doku.php?id=sajas)).

## To run
To run this project you need to download the JADE framework.

Then, compile the project with:
    
    javac -d "out/" -sourcepath "src/" -cp "path/to/jade.jar" src/world/World.java
With the class files generated, now run:
    
    java -cp "out/;path/to/jade.jar" world.World <nAudience> <nCompetitors> <nItems> <highConfidenceRate> <tries> <rounds>

### Possible errors
Some errors you might run into:
 - Port 9090 must be unoccupied before running the project, either kill the process occupying it, or change the port in the code.
 - Agent(s) dying during execution. If for any reason an agent dies, the execution of the program stops.
